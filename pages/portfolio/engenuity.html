	<h1>About Engenuity</h1>
	<p>Engenuity is a 2d/3d game engine made using the Light Weight Java Game Library (LWJGL), with inspiration
	from the frameworks used for the Unity and Source game engines. The engine started out as a way to condense
	and streamline utilities for several other projects I was working on. It's roots can be traced to an early
	project that used Processing's core library. While processing is useful for quick prototypes, the render
	pipeline (built on Java's AWT) wasn't able to support several of my needs. So I replaced Processing with
	LWJGL and its OpenGL rendering pipeline.</p>
	<h2>Projects Using Engenuity</h2>
	<p>I have several projects that use the engine. Making these projects has helped find weaknesses in
	functionality. PicTile is a collection of simple 2d games, and was the earliest project the engine was made
	for.
