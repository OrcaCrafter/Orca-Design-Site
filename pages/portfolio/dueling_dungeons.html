		<h2>Dueling Dungeons</h2>
		Dueling Dungeons is a multiplayer twist on the classic dungeon crawling formula. The core gameplay of
		finding loot, improving you character, exploring further and avoiding traps and monsters are all the
		same. However, you now have to contend with an entire server competing to be the last one standing.
		Unlike a traditional battle royal or dungeon crawler, there is no combat. Your opposition has to be
		eliminated through deception and traps.

		<h3>Game Thesis</h3>
		<p>
			The design thesis for Dueling Dungeons is to focus on mechanical depth, instead of feature bredth.
			When designing a new mechanic focus should be placed on what it can, and what it could do. The more
			features connect, the longer the community for the game can innovate. The longer the community can
			innovate, the healthier the lifespan of the game. The game will also be designed with mod support
			in mind, as mod support builds a better community, and allows for faster development on new features.
		</p>
		<p>
			Secondairily, the game will focus on a non predatory pricing model. Part of this includes a free to
			play version of the game that has access to public servers and can connect to friends. To host a private
			game with a friend group, only one person should be expected to pay. The paid version will allow access
			to private hosting, additional single player modes and personal custumization. The only payment required
			for cosmetics is the purchase of the full version of the game.
		</p>

		<h3>Art Style</h3>
		<p>Currently, all of Dueling Dungeons art assets are placeholders from other artists, or programmer art.
		However, every game needs a solid and unique art direction to stand out. For Dueling Dungeons the plan
		is to add a simple and replicable twist to classic pixel art.</p>
		<p>Inspired by graph paper doodles I would make in math class, claustrum pixel art allows for adding
		boarders and diagnol lines ontop of pixels. This is encoded into the textures by doubling the
		horizontal width of each texture with every other pixel encoding the extra information. A shader then
		interprets the texture data, creating the desired output.</p>

		<h3>Current Development Progreess</h3>
		<p>The game development has been on hold while I have been making improvements to the engine, and focusing
			on other projects. Currently, basic local multiplayer is functioning, as well as modular player classes,
			dynamic world generation and modular entity behavior. Tile updates and the inventory system are still
			works in progress.
