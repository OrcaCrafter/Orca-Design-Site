		<h2>Training Complex</h2>
		<p>
			Team Fortress 2's tutorials struggle to teach a modern audience about the game. Its tutorials
			<a href = "https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Target">tr_target</a> and
			<a href = "https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Dustbowl_(Training)">tr_dustbowl</a>.
			(The later is a modified version of
			<a href = "https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Dustbowl">cp_dustbowl)</a>,
			focus on the basics of a first person shooter. These maps only cover 4 of the nine classes,
			with soldiers having 2 sections, both of which focus on unversal game mechanics. These tutorials
			where likely made with an inexperiences audience in mind. They were realeased when the game made
			avaliable on Apple's MacOS, and only a year before the game when free-to-play.
		</p>
		<p>
			Training complex aims to teach a more versed audience about the newances of Team Fortress 2's
			mechanics in a way that engages the player, and encurages discovery, over lecture. Therefore,
			the map is built to provide challenges to the players, and reward the utilization of class 
			specific mechanics. A section does exist for the basics mechanics, but this acts a very brief
			skippable introduction.
		</p>
		<p>
			The complex itself is broken down into several sections, each one focusing on a different facet
			of gameplay.

		<h3 id="basic">Fundamentals / Basic Weapon Use</h3>
		<div class="section">
			<div class="section-text">
				<p>The basic weapon use objective is found closest to the spawn room, and consists of
				a shooting range (much like tr_target) to practice aim, reaction speed and ammo management.
				Unlike tr_target, this room won't focus on explaining the mechanics of each weapon, but
				instead will adapt to the class the player is using, and give objective that focus on
				both the strength and weaknesses of the class. For example sniper, a long range class, would
				have distant targets, interspersed with occasional targets that punish tunnel vision. Overall
				the score would be based on accuracy percentage and time to kill.</p>
			</div>

		<h3 id="1v1">1v1 Skirmish</h3>
		<div class="section">
			<div class="section-text">
				<p>
					The 1v1 skirmish area is found near the basic weapon use area, and is a fenced off
					area on the roof of the complex. As the name suggests, a single bot can be found there,
					and your goal is to kill them, before they kill you. One round of 1v1 has you face the
					5 classic skirmish classes (Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demo and Heavy), and ranks you on total
					damage taken, the time it took to kill them and how many times you died.
				</p>
			</div>

		</div>



		<h3 id="rollout">Rollouts</h3>
		<div class="section">
			<div class="section-text">
				<p>
					The rollouts course takes up by far the most space of any objective, spanning from a
					large room at the bottom of the complex, to a small area at the top. A flank route the
					goes outside the complex also exists. Players must travel from a spawn room in the bottom area
					to the top as fast as possible, while preserving health and ammo. Dying resets the rollout.
					Instead of directly scoring the player on their stats, upon arriving at the object a wave of
					bots is spawned. The score is based on how many of the bots could be delt with, how fast the bots
					were killed, and how fast the player reached the end. This more complicated system appropriatly
					punishes weapons that are great for rollout, but harm a players ability to fight, such as gunboats,
					the GRU and other mobility aids. To enforce more creativity, there is a bottleneck along the
					path in the form of a gate on the main path that only opens after a certain amount of time.
					However, this can be avoided by utilizing the geometry or a better choice of weapons.

		<h3 id="walkway">Defending from Attackers</h3>
		<div class="section">
			<div class="section-text">
				<p>
					This objective is heavily inspired by the existing community made map
					<a href = "https://gamebanana.com/mods/74812">tr_walkway</a>. This map sends wave after wave
					of bots down the titular walkway, allowing for the player to practice aim on more complicated
					targets. To focus the objective more on defense, the bots will use pathfinding similar to
					Mann vs Machine, the PVE gamemode in TF2. The score would be based on the difficulty of the kill
					(airborne, long distance, stronger class), and the number of bots killed without one missed.
				</p>
			</div>
			<img class="section-image" src="/assets/photos/tf2/tr_complex/walkway.png"></img>

		<h3 id="objective">Objective simulator</h3>
		<div class="section">
			<div class="section-text">
				<p>
					The objective simulator is a section of the map with the 3 main objective types featured in the game,
					control points, capture the flag and payload, for both attacking and defending. After choosing which
					of the 6 scenarois the player would like to play out, the objectives are configured and bots are spawned.
					When defending, the goal is to out last the timer, with sub objectives and certain incriments. Addional
					objectives relate to fighting back bots and discourage overly 'turtling' play styles. Offsensive
					scenarios will naturally have completing the object as its main goal, with sub objectives for how close
					the play got, and will discourage playstyles that are overly aggressive.
