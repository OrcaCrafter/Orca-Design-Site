		<h2>Animality</h2>
		Animality is an anthropomorphic social simulation game where you revitalize a failed city
		through odd jobs and socializing.

					<h3>Room Designer</h3>
					<p>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The room designer is based on early doom and quake style level editors.
These editors feature a top down view of the rooms. The floor and ceiling heights are
modified for each convex 'sector'. Like later implentations of this concept, the floor and
ceiling of each sector can be linearly sloped by adding a pair of refrence points. This
information is used to build a mesh of each sector, and all the sector meshes are joined
to make the entire interior. The room can now be designed with static or dynamic
decorations.<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Static decorations are any props that do not adapt to their enviroment.
The current plan for static prop decoration is to define a placement mesh for each prop
added. This placement mesh will control how props can be place based on 3 simple rules.
First, every bottom face must in contact with a valid top surface. Secondly, a valid top
surface consists of a level room floor, or a marked top face of a prop. And lastly, the
placement mesh for the prop must not intersect with any geometry.<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Dynamic decorations are for props that can change based on relevant data.
Dynamic dectorations are defined by a script that is given a set of relevant key points.
These key points are typically defined by other props in the scene. For example, a flag
pole could define the attachment points for a flag. The flag could then scale itself based
on the spacing of the flag pole key points. Fairy lights and other hanging details could
be connected between a sequence of hooks. Power cables can run from outlets to devices.<br>

					<h3>World Generation</h3>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The current world generation exists as a way to store a 3d tile map
as a texture. The system current supports static tiles, tiles effected by their neighbors
and tiles that use the dual grid system. This system should be scalable for several
outdoors features. Proceedural generation could be used to create the starting condition
of the map, and a 2d version of marching cubes could be added for more structure.<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The current system being based on a texture is rather clunky, so a
custom file format is definitely planned.
