		<h2>About Anti-Back-Ward</h2>
			<p>
			Anti-Back-Ward is a 2d puzzle platformer made by myself, with assets created by my friends,
			for the 2023 GMTK <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqJ-Xo29CKyLTjn6z2XwYAw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Game Makers Tool Kit)</a> Game Jam.
			You play as a white cat in a surrealist looping world, trying to get to a floating mirror and progress to the next level.
			</p>
			<h2>Gameplay</h2>
			<p>
			Anti-Back-Ward's core gameplay boils down to navigating to the levels objective (a small floating mirror),
			and collecting the optional coins along the way. In order to traverse the levels you have to utilize basic
			2d platforming, the purple mirror dimension tiles, and navigate around the green blockers.
			</p>
			<p>
			Throughout the levels you can find pink / magenta platforms. When standing on these platforms and activating
			your special ability, they start looping (in a mirrored fashion) as well. These are called the mirror portals,
			and they make up the majority of the puzzle aspect. While they are active, you can only interact with
			them, and a few other objects. If your move is used again, the mirror portal closes, potentially killing you
			or letting you interact with a new portal in a new place.
			</p>
		<h2>Theming</h2>
			The theming of the game leans towards abstract. The music (Made by
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jifyrex1217/">Jifyrex</a>) is a slow, surreal track, while the art
			(Made by <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/codexcracked/"></a>) is predominantly mute tones, with select
			highlights. These highlights are reserved for mirror platforms (purple and magenta), the end goal and 
			pickups (gold and cyan), and the blocker enemies (dark green). The background consists of abstract
			gray, light gray and near white patterns using a small selection of tiles. Theses patterns hint at how
			the level can be pieced together.

				<button class="carousel-button next" data-carousel-button=1>&#8658;</button>
				<ul data-slides>
					<li class="slide" data-active>
						<h3>Level 1</h3>
						<p>The goal of a first level is to introduce concepts quickly and concisely. The layout of this level is
						setup to teach the player the scale of the players movement, and the basics of gameplay.</p>
						<img src="/assets/photos/abw/level1.png" alt="Level 1">
					</li>
					<li class="slide">
						<h3>Level 2</h3>
						<p>Like level 1, this level immediately shows the player the objective, but it is out of reach.
						Because this level is introducing the looping mechanic for the first time, it's kept to one axis. 
						The staircase acts as a one way barrier, further demonstrating the looping nature of the game
						(especially to anyone who misses the jump)</p>
						<img src="/assets/photos/abw/level2.png" alt="Level 2">
					</li>
					<li class="slide">
						<h3>Level 3</h3>
						<p>This is the first level with a) the mirror region and b) any hazard. The objective is across a pit
						of spikes that are far too wide to jump. The only option the player has is to follow the prompt and press
						enter while standing on the region. While the geometry might seem a bit random, it is actually setup to
						force the player to stand directly on the region. Then, it shows that the player can now walk through walls (with
						the help of a coin indicator) and that the player is likely to die in a wall if the exit the mirror mode 
						in the wrong spot.</p>
						<img src="/assets/photos/abw/level3a.png" alt="Level 3 Normally">
					</li>
					<li class="slide">
						<h3>Level 4</h3>
						<p>This is the first 'real' level, though it keeps the concepts minimal. It starts with a small platforming
						section, before teaching the player about how spikes and walls are ignored while in the mirror region, through
						the use of a staircase that can't normally be traversed.<p>
						<img src="/assets/photos/abw/level4a.png" alt="Level 4 Normally">
					</li>
					<li class="slide">
						<h3>Level 5</h3>
						<p>Level 5 stands out as a very simplistic puzzle. The object is trapped in the ground below you, but there
						is a mirror region with a divot that lets you access it. Unfortunately, that divot does not line up. At least
						at first. By continuously wrapping the screen, due to the co-prime sizes of the region and the
						room, it eventually lines up.</p>
						<img src="/assets/photos/abw/level5a.png" alt="Level 5 Normally">
					<li class="slide">
						<h3>Level 6</h3>
						<p>Level 6 introduces the last new mechanic, and is the first level with more than 1 mirror region. The new
						blocker enemy provides both an obstacle to be cleared with the mirror region and a helping platform as the
						player descends to the goal. Uniquely, the blocker can be interacted with while in the mirror mode, but can
						also be crushed by the mirror mode, as this level demonstrates.</p>
						<img src="/assets/photos/abw/level6.png" alt="Level 6">
					</li>
					<li class="slide">
						<h3>Level 7</h3>
						<p>Level 7 requires an understanding of all the mechanics, and forces the player
							to unravel the intended solution. The puzzle is solved by using the mirror dimension
							and screen wrapping to reach platforms you otherwise couldn't, in order to clear the
							area with the end goal.
						</p>
						<img src="/assets/photos/abw/level7.png" alt="Level 7">
					</li>
					<li class="slide">
						<h3>Level 8</h3>
						<p>Level 8 acts as a send off to the mirror mechanic. It features the most
							mirror sections, but each one only opens up access to a few nearby locations.
							The challenge of this level is not from piecing together mechanics, but instead
							by understanding them well enough to not get caught out.
						</p>
