	<h1>About Anti-Back-Ward</h1>
		<p>
		Anti-Back-Ward is a 2d puzzle platformer made by myself, with assets created by my friends,
		for the 2023 GMTK <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqJ-Xo29CKyLTjn6z2XwYAw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Game Makers Tool Kit)</a> Game Jam.
		You play as a white cat in a surrealist looping world, trying to get to a floating mirror and progress to the next level.
		Throughout the levels you can find pink / magenenta platforms. When standing on these platforms and activating
		your special ability, they start looping (in a mirrored fasion) aswell. These are called the mirror portals,
		and they make up the majority of the puzzle aspect. While they are active, you can only interact with
		them, and a few other objects. If your move is used again, the mirror portal closes, potentially killing you
		or letting you interact with a new portal in a new place. --Note: Clean this up. Move gameplay to later

		<h3>Level 1</h3>
			<p>The problem with all first levels is the delicate balance of teaching the player nearly everything about
			the game, while not overwhelming them. With this first level, I decided to keep it small for many reasons.
			While Anti-Back-Ward is not a true 1 screen game, it does focus on small puzzles with backtracking and
			minimal platforming. So, for a player to be comfortable with these mechanics they need to immediately be
			show how fast you can walk, how high you can jump and how to progress.</p>
			<p>By placing the goal on an elevated platform the player has to go underneath, it will tempt them
			into trying to jump straight up to it. Of course, they can't. The jump in this game isn't meant to be
			a solution to any puzzle. Instead it acts as a means to an end. By having the actual solution be to
			jump from the other side, off of a small ledge already teaches the player that speed and acceleration
			aren't a major factor to consider. The coins in the level trace a simple path that nearly every player
			will associate with a jump arc, and visually shows how jumps act. Finally, the repeated versions of the
			level to the sides are in-accessable but visible, introducing a main mechanic early, allowing for it to be
			built up to.</p>
		<h3>Level 2</h3>
			<p>Like level 1, this level immediately shows the player the objective, but, it is beyond out of reach.
			Because the level is introducing the looping </p>
