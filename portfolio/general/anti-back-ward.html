	<h1>About Anti-Back-Ward</h1>
		<p>
		Anti-Back-Ward is a 2d puzzle platformer made by myself, with assets created by my friends,
		for the 2023 GMTK <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqJ-Xo29CKyLTjn6z2XwYAw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Game Makers Tool Kit)</a> Game Jam.
		You play as a white cat in a surrealist looping world, trying to get to a floating mirror and progress to the next level.
		Throughout the levels you can find pink / magenenta platforms. When standing on these platforms and activating
		your special ability, they start looping (in a mirrored fasion) aswell. These are called the mirror portals,
		and they make up the majority of the puzzle aspect. While they are active, you can only interact with
		them, and a few other objects. If your move is used again, the mirror portal closes, potentially killing you
		or letting you interact with a new portal in a new place. --Note: Clean this up. Move gameplay to later

		<!-- TODO Describe ABW Theming -->
	<h2>Level Design</h2>
		<h3>Level 1</h3>
			<p>The goal of a first level is to introduce concepts quickly and concisely. The layout of this level is
			setup to teach the player the scale of the players movement, and the basics of gameplay.</p>
		<h3>Level 2</h3>
			<p>Like level 1, this level immediately shows the player the objective, but it is out of reach.
			Because this level is introducing the looping mechanic for the first time, it's kept to one axis. 
			The staircase acts as a one way barrier, further demonstrating the looping nature of the game
			(especially to anyone who misses the jump)</p>
		<h3>Level 3</h3>
			<p>This is the first level with a) the mirror region and b) any hazard. The objective is across a pit
			of spikes that are far too wide to jump. The only option the player has is to follow the prompt and press
			enter while standing on the region. While the geometry might seem a bit random, it is actually setup to
			force the player to stand directly on the region, show that the player can now walk through walls (with
			the help of a coin indicator) and that the player is likely to die in a wall if the exit the mirror mode 
			in the wrong spot.</p>
		<h3>Level 4</h3>
			<p>This is the first 'real' level, though it keeps the concepts minimal. It starts with a small platforming
			section, before teaching the player about how spikes and walls are ignored while in the mirror region, through
			the use of a staircase that can't normally be traversed.<p>
		<h3>Level 5</h3>
			<p>Level 5 stands out as a very simplistic puzzle. The object is trapped in the ground below you, but there
			is a mirror region with a divit that lets you access it. Unfortunately, that divit does not line up. At least
			at first. By continuously wrapping the screen, due to the co-prime sizes of the region and the
			room, it eventually lines up.</p>
		<h3>Level 6</h3>
			<p>Level 6 introduces the last new mechanic, and is the first level with more than 1 mirror region. The new
			blocker enemy provides both an obstacle to be cleared with the mirror region and a helping platform as the
			player descends to the goal. Uniquely, the blocker can be interacted with while in the mirror mode, but can
			also be crushed by the mirror mode, as this level demonstrates.</p>
